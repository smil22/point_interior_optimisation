# point_interior_optimisation

If you are committed to Data Science, you know what optimisation methods mean and that they are a must in all the applications of machine and deep learning algorithms. <br>
One of them is [interior point method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior-point_method). <br>
See one way of doing it on a non-linear program with a certain number of linear inequality constraints and only positivity constraint on the variable.
